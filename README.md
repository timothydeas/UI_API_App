# UI API App

## The goal is to design and test a split-view interface: one side shows what a generic travel booking experience could look like once the EPS API is integrated into a Partner’s website (without being customized for any specific Partner), and the other side shows the related API activity or response. Inline feedback fields will allow Partners to share contextual insights—such as challenges, pain points, desires, and needs—as they evaluate the experience.
